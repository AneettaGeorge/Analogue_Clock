# Analogue Clock Project

Welcome to the Analogue Clock Project! This project is a simple implementation of an analogue clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Analogue Clock Project aims to create a visually appealing and functional analogue clock that displays the current time. The project utilizes basic HTML structure for the clock face, CSS for styling and positioning, and JavaScript for updating the clock hands dynamically.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Smooth Animation**: Utilizes CSS transitions and JavaScript to create smooth and realistic movement of the clock hands.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing experience.

## Usage

- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
- The analogue clock will automatically start displaying the current time.
- You can also customize the clock by modifying the CSS styles or JavaScript code to suit your preferences
